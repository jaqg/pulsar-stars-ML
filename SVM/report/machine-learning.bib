  abstract = {A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training patterns and the decision boundary is presented. The technique is applicable to a wide variety of the classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms.},

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

  abstract = {We provide a new way to compute and evaluate Gaussian radial basis function interpolants in a stable way with a special focus on small values of the shape parameter, i.e., for “flat” kernels. This work is motivated by the fundamental ideas proposed earlier by Bengt Fornberg and his coworkers. However, following Mercer's theorem, an \$L\_2(\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d, \textbackslash rho)\$-orthonormal expansion of the Gaussian kernel allows us to come up with an algorithm that is simpler than the one proposed by Fornberg, Larsson, and Flyer and that is applicable in arbitrary space dimensions d. In addition to obtaining an accurate approximation of the radial basis function interpolant (using many terms in the series expansion of the kernel), we also propose and investigate a highly accurate least-squares approximation based on early truncation of the kernel expansion.}

  abstract = {The LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS) is the most sensitive untargeted radio pulsar survey performed at low radio frequencies (119--151\textbackslash,MHz) to date and has discovered 76 new radio pulsars, among which the 23.5-s pulsar J0250+5854, up until recently the slowest-spinning radio pulsar known. Here, we report on the timing solutions of 35 pulsars discovered by LOTAAS, which include a nulling pulsar and a mildly recycled pulsar, and thereby complete the full timing analysis of the LOTAAS pulsar discoveries. We give an overview of the findings from the full LOTAAS sample of 76 pulsars, discussing their pulse profiles, radio spectra and timing parameters. We found that the pulse profiles of some of the pulsars show profile variations in time or frequency and while some pulsars show signs of scattering, a large majority display no pulse broadening. The LOTAAS discoveries have on average steeper radio spectra and have longer spin periods (\$1.4\textbackslash times\$) as well as lower spin-down rates (\$3.1\textbackslash times\$) compared to the known pulsar population. We discuss the cause of these differences, and attribute them to a combination of selection effects of the LOTAAS survey as well as previous pulsar surveys, though can not rule out that older pulsars tend to have steeper radio spectra.},
